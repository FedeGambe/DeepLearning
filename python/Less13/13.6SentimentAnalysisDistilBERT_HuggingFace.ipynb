It has 40% smaller than BERT and runs 60% faster while preserving over 95% of BERT's performance.\n","\n","\n","DistilBERT (Distilled BERT) is a smaller and more efficient version of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The primary goal of DistilBERT is to reduce the size and computational requirements of BERT while preserving its essential capabilities. Here are some key differences between DistilBERT and BERT:\n","\n","**Tokenizer:**\n","- BERT: BERT's tokenizer is an integral part of the model architecture. The BERT model includes both the transformer layers for processing the input data and the associated tokenization mechanisms within the same model structure. The tokenizer is not a separate, standalone component.When you use a BERT model, you typically utilize its built-in tokenizer (WordPiece tokenization) to preprocess and tokenize the input text.\n","- DistilBERT: DistilBERT's has not integrated tokenizer, so text MUST be tokenize before to feed the model.\n","\n","\n","**Model Size:**\n","- BERT: BERT models are large and contain a significant number of parameters. For instance, the original BERT-base model has 110 million parameters.\n","- DistilBERT: DistilBERT is a smaller model, designed to be more lightweight. It has only about 40% of the parameters of the BERT-base model.\n","\n","**Training Process:**\n","- BERT: BERT is pre-trained on a large corpus of text using unsupervised learning. The pre-training involves predicting masked words in a sentence and learning contextualized representations.\n","- DistilBERT: DistilBERT is trained using a process called knowledge distillation. It is trained to reproduce the behavior of the larger BERT model. The idea is to transfer the knowledge encoded in the larger model to the smaller one.\n","\n","**Computation Efficiency:**\n","- BERT: Due to its size, BERT models require significant computational resources for both training and inference. This can be a limitation in resource-constrained environments.\n","- DistilBERT: DistilBERT is designed to be more computationally efficient, making it suitable for deployment in scenarios where computational resources are limited.\n","\n","**Performance:**\n","- BERT: Larger models like BERT often achieve state-of-the-art performance on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but they come with higher computational costs.\n","- DistilBERT: While DistilBERT is smaller and more computationally efficient, it may not perform as well as BERT on some tasks due to its reduced capacity. However, it still retains a significant portion of BERT's performance.\n","\n","**Use Cases:**\n","- BERT: BERT is often used in research and applications where maximum performance is critical, such as in competitions and benchmarks.\n","- DistilBERT: DistilBERT is suitable for applications where there are resource constraints, and a balance between performance and efficiency is needed. It can be more practical for deployment in real-world scenarios."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gZTBUijv4iv_"},"source":["<img src= \"https://frenzy86.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/python/nlp/nlp6.3.jpg\" width=1000>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"v-WZqWAwUHqV"},"source":["**Introduction to DistilBERT:** DistilBERT, short for \"Distill and BERT,\" is a compact version of the renowned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model.\n","\n","**Model Architecture:** It reduces the number of layers and attention heads, resulting in a smaller and faster model.\n","\n","**Parameter Reduction:** One of DistilBERT's key features is its parameter reduction strategy, achieved by distillation.

Rather, from the first minutes of the movie where we see baby Hitler looking evil with evil music playing the background, we are given a view of Hitler that presents his as a cartoony supervillian, seemingly ripped right out of a Saturday morning TV show. The film REALLY wants to make its case that Hitler was evil but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was evil? Ultimately, making him such a one-dimensionally evil character is both boring and confusing (one must ask how the inept, phsycotic character in the film cold ever persuade a nation to follow him or be named Time's man of the year). This film had a great opportunity to take a figure who has committed some of the most horrible acts in the 20th century, and try to delve into his mind. Instead, it basically just says, \\\"Hey! Hitler was evil! Just thought you might like to know...\\\" over and over again. The great irony is that the film still was attacked for presenting too sympathetic a view of the character. Give me a break.\",\n          \"\\\"Xizao\\\", is the tale about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions, and its effects on a family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu), is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe that his father Liu (Xu Zhu), has died. He founds that his father is still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his father old business, the public bathroom.<br /><br />The movie centers around Da Ming's family, and how he has to learn the importance of his father's job, something he always had considered an old tradition that had to die soon. Also, the movie explores his relationship with Er Ming, who is mentally challenged, and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies, but also their souls.<br /><br />The two main themes of the movie, the family and the problems of progress, are incredibly well handled, and the movie never loses the point it is trying to make, both themes are very good developed and we get a glimpse of Chinese society and customs.<br /><br />The director, Yang Zhang, tells his tale in a simple way, letting the characters characters do the job. It is a very simple approach, but it fits the movie perfectly, and I highly doubt that another style would fit the movie this good. Zhang has enormous potential, as he can tell a story without the aid of visual flare or camera tricks.<br /><br />The acting is outstanding in its naturalistic approach, everyone acts in a very natural way and it almost looks as if they were real persons being filmed. The three lead characters give remarkable performances, and Wu Jiang as Er Ming surely steals the show.<br /><br />Even when the movie could had sticked to a patronizing \\\"old days were much better\\\" message, instead it takes an attitude of equilibrium, like saying that progress is good, and we must move on, but we must not forget where we came from, and keep an equilibrium between modern life and the traditions of old.<br /><br />An awesome, and touching film. 8/10\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

shoddiness.this is, of course, milligan's take on the sweeney todd tale, done with period costumes (but not necessarily period hairstyles, in some cases) and the usual headache-inducing camera-work & grainy quality. as for the gore, well, the version i saw may have been cut some, for there's not a lot, for a film with \\\"bloodthirsty\\\" in the title. the best indication of subversive film-making here is a meat pie consisting only of some poor victim's tit.so, while i will still treasure this piece of, uh, work, on my video shelf, it's definitely somewhat of a letdown as far as content though. recommended for only the foolhardy & morbidly curious. 3 out of 10.\",\n          \"simply put, this is a simplistic and one dimensional film. the title, the rise to evil, should tell you that this isn't going to attempt to be anything deep or do much with hitler's character. rather, from the first minutes of the movie where we see baby hitler looking evil with evil music playing the background, we are given a view of hitler that presents his as a cartoony supervillian, seemingly ripped right out of a saturday morning tv show. the film really wants to make its case that hitler was evil but does anyone need a movie to convince them that hitler was evil? ultimately, making him such a one-dimensionally evil character is both boring and confusing (one must ask how the inept, phsycotic character in the film cold ever persuade a nation to follow him or be named time's man of the year). this film had a great opportunity to take a figure who has committed some of the most horrible acts in the 20th century, and try to delve into his mind. instead, it basically just says, \\\"hey! hitler was evil! just thought you might like to know...\\\" over and over again. the great irony is that the film still was attacked for presenting too sympathetic a view of the character. give me a break.\",\n          \"\\\"xizao\\\", is the tale about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions, and its effects on a family in china. da ming (quanxiu pu), is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother er ming (wu jiang) makes him believe that his father liu (xu zhu), has died. he founds that his father is still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his father old business, the public bathroom.the movie centers around da ming's family, and how he has to learn the importance of his father's job, something he always had considered an old tradition that had to die soon. also, the movie explores his relationship with er ming, who is mentally challenged, and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies, but also their souls.the two main themes of the movie, the family and the problems of progress, are incredibly well handled, and the movie never loses the point it is trying to make, both themes are very good developed and we get a glimpse of chinese society and customs.the director, yang zhang, tells his tale in a simple way, letting the characters characters do the job. it is a very simple approach, but it fits the movie perfectly, and i highly doubt that another style would fit the movie this good. zhang has enormous potential, as he can tell a story without the aid of visual flare or camera tricks.the acting is outstanding in its naturalistic approach, everyone acts in a very natural way and it almost looks as if they were real persons being filmed. the three lead characters give remarkable performances, and wu jiang as er ming surely steals the show.even when the movie could had sticked to a patronizing \\\"old days were much better\\\" message, instead it takes an attitude of equilibrium, like saying that progress is good, and we must move on, but we must not forget where we came from, and keep an equilibrium between modern life and the traditions of old.an awesome, and touching film. 8/10\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

The goal is to distill the valuable information, generalizations, and patterns learned by the sophisticated teacher model into a compact student model, which typically has fewer parameters. This knowledge transfer is achieved by training the student model to mimic not only the final predictions of the teacher model but also the internal representations or knowledge embedded within the teacher's layers. Distillation is often used to create lightweight models suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing performance.\n","\n","<img src=

Instead of using high-precision floating-point numbers, quantization involves mapping these values to a lower-precision format, typically integers or fixed-point numbers. This reduction in precision helps in compressing the model size and accelerates inference, making it more feasible to deploy deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones, edge devices, or IoT devices. Despite the loss of precision, careful quantization methods aim to minimize the impact on the model's overall performance by mitigating the introduced quantization errors\n","\n","<img src= \"https://frenzy86.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/python/nlp/quantization.png\"\n","width=1000>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":78,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ZLGJ_yaiTxkK","outputId":"44fec15d-8254-46c5-ef01-d97fb4aae05d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709144267953,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":5371,"user":{"displayName":"T3Lab Vision","userId":"14779383426442114373"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["WARNING:root:Please consider to run pre-processing before quantization.
